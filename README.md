## Introduction
The thesis investigates the challenges and methodologies in classifying images related to warfare using state-of-the-art deep learning models. By leveraging the power of ResNet, this research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of image classification in the context of war imagery.

## Datasets

The project utilizes several datasets containing war-related images. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, please ensure you have the appropriate permissions to use these datasets.

## Model Architecture

The core of the project is based on the ResNet50 architecture. ResNet is known for its ability to train very deep neural networks without the vanishing gradient problem. This makes it particularly suitable for complex image classification tasks.

## Results

The results of the image classification experiments are documented in the thesis. Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided.
